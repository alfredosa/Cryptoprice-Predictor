# Cryptoprice-Predictor

# Given a Cryptocurrency (Cardano) Price, the model will learn to predict "Volume".

# Maps first all the historical data of a Cryptocurrency (Cardano), cleans and analyses the data, trains real-time the ML Model (Sequential model), and predicts Volume based on Price. Also it shows you cool graphs.
# Even though volume is an important factor, it does not necessarily determine the price and viceversa without context (Other variables). But this was an experiment to attempt to predict values.
# Better things coming 💪🏼

# Data: Alpha Vantage API
# Libraries: tensorflow JS, chart JS
